### âœ… Key Sync Logic Principles

1. **Manager is authoritative**
    
    - `SlidingIcons` holds the `icons` list, defines positions, and reorders icons.
        
    - Each `DraggableIcon` just knows its `iconIndex` and calls manager when dropped.
        
2. **Do not overwrite indices every frame**
    
    - Only update indices **when the order actually changes** (initial assignment + after snapping).
        
3. **Avoid `GameObject.Find` for dynamic lists**
    
    - Instead, use the hierarchy (children of a known parent) or inspector assignment.
        
    - This ensures `Start()` always finds all icons and adds them to the manager properly.
        
4. **Drag state separation**
    
    - `isDragging` prevents your smooth Lerp from fighting the mouse movement.
